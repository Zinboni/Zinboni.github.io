### **A Free-Data-Set example that can be found through Github:**
* An _Introduction to R - Notes on R: A Programming Environment for Data Analysis and Graphics_ by **W. N. Venables, D. M. Smith and the R Core Team**. The link to this free book is https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf and can be accessed [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf).
* I'm interested in this book since Iâ€™ve had some prior experience using R Studio but I wish to improve my knowledge and see the different ways in which I can incorporate it into projects involving data sets and analysis.
