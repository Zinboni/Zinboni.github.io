### **A Free Dataset sample that can be found through Github:**
* The _“World Bank Data”_.
* The link to this free dataset is https://data.worldbank.org/ and can be accessed [here](https://data.worldbank.org/).
* _The World Bank_ dataset can provide a wide range of data involving all sorts of economical measurements from around the world. Which can help you to see how every country varies around the world in terms of the _quality of education, healthcare, agriculture, and a multitude of other important datasets involving different countries_.


### **A Free-Data-Science book that can be found through Github:**
* An _Introduction to R - Notes on R: A Programming Environment for Data Analysis and Graphics_ by **W. N. Venables, D. M. Smith and the R Core Team**. The link to this free book is https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf and can be accessed [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf).
* I'm interested in this book since I’ve had some prior experience using R Studio but I wish to improve my knowledge and see the different ways in which I can incorporate it into projects involving data sets and analysis.
